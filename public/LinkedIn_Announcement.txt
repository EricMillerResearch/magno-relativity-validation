Today we completed the first head-to-head comparison between Einstein’s General Relativity and a new field model: Magno-Relativity.

Using real astronomical data from 98 pulsar systems (ATNF catalogue), the result was decisive:
• General Relativity fails 74 of 98 systems
• Magno-Relativity fits 83 of 98
• Mean residual error reduced by 25.46×
• No tuning parameters or added variables — same dataset, same constraints

A reproducibility package (dataset, code, figures, and blockchain timestamp) is available to qualified labs, investors, and strategic partners under NDA.

The next era of physics has begun.
