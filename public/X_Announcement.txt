We just ran 98 pulsar systems head-to-head:
General Relativity vs Magno-Relativity.

GR fails 74/98.
MR fits 83/98.
Residual error = 25× smaller.
Same dataset. Zero tuning. No extra parameters.

This isn’t a theory. This is the first confirmed replacement for Einstein.
Proof package available under NDA.
